Simple compiler for C built in C.
The idea is to build a front end, back end configuration. in detail lexer + parser + semantic analyzer + code generation combination
Resource used include a series of forums and blog posts, as well as two very important books:
- "Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools" by Dragon

Lexical Analyzer current goal is to read a file of basic arithmatic functions and perform analysis to split into tokens.
Implementation will be done in C aimed at C, grammar either BNF or Regex.
